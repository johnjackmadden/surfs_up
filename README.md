# Surfs Up
## Overview
### The purpose of this analysis is to process temperature data from stations around Hawaii to determine if the weather is temperate enough to sustain a surf/ice cream shop year round.
## Results
### The results of our data focus on two specific months that highlight the height of a season; June and December. For June, the mean temperature was about 75 degrees Fahrenheit, with a standard deviation of 3.25, which allows us to infer that the data set is fairly well distributed and uniform. For December, the mean temperature was arond 71 degrees fariehnhieht, with a standard deviation of 3.74, which also demonstrates a fairly reasonable distributed data set for decemeber as well. The main take aways from these results are.
### * There is not too much varience in the average temperature from the peak of summer to the peak of winter.
### * The data is fairly well distributed in both months with a low standard deviation.
### * The max temperature for june and decemeber is 85 and 83 degrees respectively.
## Summary
### In summary, looking at the weather report it seems that in terms of temperature this can be a fairly successful business venture. The temperature alone seems very comofortable, but could possibly be on the low end for what would be an acceptable temperature range: since people tend to do outdoor water sports and consume ice cream the hotter it is outside. I would also recomend further analysis for weather patters, since rain or drought would impact the viability of a business that is so contingent on agreeable weather
